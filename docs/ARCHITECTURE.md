# ARS Pipeline Architecture (v3.5.1)

Full pipeline view across stages × skills × artifacts × gates. Every completed stage requires a user-confirmation checkpoint (per `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` and `pipeline_state_machine.md`); the diagrams below surface the **decision-heavy** checkpoints visually so they are easy to locate. The post-stage confirmation checkpoints at 2.5 and 4.5 are machine-verified first, then confirmed by the user — they are not skipped.

## How to read

- **Flow diagram** (§2): macro view — which stage follows which, where loops exist, where gates block. Every rectangle ends in a post-stage user confirmation (elided for readability); 🧑 markers call out the decision-heavy moments where the user chooses a branch.
- **Matrix** (§3): the only place where (stage × skill × mode × data_level × artifacts × agents × gate) all co-exist. Use this when asking "what happens at Stage X?" The Gate column lists both machine checks and the user-confirmation checkpoint that closes the stage.
- **Data access flow** (§4) and **skill graph** (§5): orthogonal views answering "who sees what" and "who depends on what" respectively.
- **Quality gates** (§6): zoom on the blocking checks — both machine-enforced and human-enforced.
- **Timeline** (§7): why the architecture looks the way it does — each v3.3.x release added one honesty primitive.
- **Modes** (§8): reference when composing a pipeline invocation.

The matrix alone is insufficient: it hides data-access hierarchy and skill dependency. The diagrams alone are insufficient: they hide artifact flow and per-stage agent detail. Together they are the full architecture.

## 1. Checkpoints (at-a-glance)

The pipeline has **two classes of user checkpoint**. Both require the user to confirm before the pipeline advances; they differ in what the user is actually deciding.

**Decision-heavy checkpoints** — the user chooses a branch or accepts a material decision:

| # | Stage | What the user decides |
|---|---|---|
| 🧑 1 | 1. RESEARCH | RQ Brief + Methodology Blueprint |
| 🧑 2 | 2. WRITE | Outline approval before drafting |
| 🧑 3 | 3. REVIEW | Editorial decision (Accept / Minor / Major / Reject) |
| 🧑 4 | 3 → 4 Revision Coaching | Revision strategy (up to 8 Socratic rounds; user can skip) |
| 🧑 5 | 4. REVISE | Revision changes confirmed |
| 🧑 6 | 3'. RE-REVIEW | Verification-review decision |
| 🧑 7 | 3' → 4' Residual Coaching | Residual-issue trade-offs (up to 5 Socratic rounds; user can skip) |
| 🧑 8 | 4'. RE-REVISE | Content frozen — no further review loop |
| 🧑 9 | 5. FINALIZE | Output format selection (MD / DOCX / LaTeX / PDF) |
| 🧑 10 | 6. PROCESS SUMMARY | Language confirmation + collaboration quality review |

**Post-stage confirmation checkpoints** — machine verification runs first; the user then acknowledges the integrity report before proceeding. These are also user-gated (per `pipeline_state_machine.md` — every stage ends in `[checkpoint]`), but the decision is "acknowledge the automated report" rather than "choose a branch":

| # | Stage | What runs | What the user acknowledges |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✓ 1 | 2.5 INTEGRITY | 7-mode failure checklist (see §3 for exact taxonomy) | Integrity Report PASS/FAIL + any SUSPECTED flags |
| ✓ 2 | 4.5 FINAL INTEGRITY | Deep Mode 2 check, zero-tolerance | Final Integrity Report PASS + populated Material Passport |

**Legend:**

- **Solid orange (✓)** = integrity gate — machine verification runs first, user then acknowledges the report. Not skipped.
- **Green** = Socratic coaching sub-stage. User may engage or say "just fix it" to skip the dialogue.
- **👁 observer** (v3.5.1) = `collaboration_depth_agent` dispatches at every FULL/SLIM checkpoint + pipeline completion. **Never blocks.** Advisory only. MANDATORY integrity gates (2.5 / 4.5) explicitly skip the observer so compliance checks are not diluted.

Rules (per `shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md`):

- `data_access_level` is a **declarative** annotation, not a runtime-enforced permission system. The CI lint `scripts/check_data_access_level.py` confirms every `SKILL.md` carries a valid value; it does not inspect context windows at runtime.
- `raw` skills consume layer-1 data (arbitrary, possibly adversarial).
- `redacted` skills operate on sanitized material, no new raw ingestion.
- `verified_only` skills run only after upstream integrity gates.
- The reviewer side **may hold a rubric privately** — the key guarantee is that rubric / gold-label content must not be present in the candidate-generating agent's context. Calibration gold sets are runtime-supplied by the human researcher, not bundled into the repository.
- Stage 2.5 and Stage 4.5 (plus the user's review at each gate) are the actual enforcement points. This pattern document explains the data-flow structure that makes those gates meaningful; it is not itself a runtime lock.

## 6. Quality Gates

Two classes of gate: **🧑 decision-heavy** (user chooses a branch or approves material) and **✓ integrity** (machine verification + user ack). Pure machine-enforced 🤖 lint checks run in CI.

| Gate | Class | Stage | What blocks advancement | Failure handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RQ + methodology confirmation | 🧑 | 1 | User hasn't approved RQ Brief and Methodology Blueprint | Revise and re-present |
| S2 API verification | 🤖 | 1 | Citation not in Semantic Scholar; title Levenshtein < 0.70 | Flag; user decides to drop or re-cite |
| Outline approval | 🧑 | 2 | User hasn't approved outline | Revise and re-present |
| Anti-leakage (v3.3) | 🤖 | 2 | Draft contains parametric fill not grounded in session materials | `[MATERIAL GAP]` tag; user provides material or accepts gap |
| VLM figure verify (v3.3) | 🤖 | 2 | Rendered figure fails 10-pt APA 7.0 checklist | Max 2 refinement iterations |
| Stage 2.5 integrity + ack | ✓ | 2.5 | Any mode SUSPECTED on 7-mode checklist, or Modes 1/3/5/6 INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, or user hasn't acknowledged report | Fix + re-verify (max 3 rounds); or user override with reasoning (logged) |
| Editor-in-Chief decision review | 🧑 | 3 | User hasn't reviewed decision letter | Present decision; await user |
| Concession threshold | 🤖 | 3 | DA rebuttal scored < 4/5 by responder | No concession; frame-lock detector runs |
| Revision Coaching | 🧑 | 3→4 | User hasn't engaged or explicitly skipped (max 8 rounds) | User may say "just fix it" to skip |
| Revision confirmation | 🧑 | 4 | User hasn't confirmed changes | Revise; re-present |
| Revision loop cap | 🤖 | 4 / 3' / 4' | 2 revision loops already consumed | Forced advance to Stage 4.5 |
| Residual Coaching | 🧑 | 3'→4' | User hasn't engaged or explicitly skipped (max 5 rounds) | User may say "just fix it" to skip |
| Content-frozen confirmation | 🧑 | 4' | User hasn't confirmed freeze | Await user; no further review loop permitted |
| Stage 4.5 final integrity + ack | ✓ | 4.5 | ANY issue on deeper 7-mode re-run; mode still SUSPECTED since 2.5 and unresolved | ZERO-tolerance; no skip; fix + re-verify |
| Format selection | 🧑 | 5 | User hasn't chosen output format | Await user format choice |
| Disclosure check | 🤖 | 5 | Venue-specific AI disclosure absent or wrong form | Block render until fixed |
| `repro_lock` (v3.3.5) | 🤖 (standalone) | — | `repro_lock` key required in Material Passport v3.3.5+; value must be either a populated block or explicit `null` (honest opt-out). Populated blocks validated by `check_repro_lock.py`. Per `artifact_reproducibility_pattern.md`: **not** wired into the CI lint suite by default and **not** read by the Stage 2.5 / 4.5 integrity gate at runtime — this is post-hoc documentation, not a pipeline block | Run `check_repro_lock.py <passport>` on demand |
| Language + collaboration review | 🧑 | 6 | User hasn't confirmed output language / reviewed self-reflection | Await user |
| `benchmark_report` (v3.3.5, external) | 🤖 | — | Publishing a benchmark without honest disclosure | Users run `check_benchmark_report.py` before publishing |
| Collaboration Depth Observer (v3.5.1) | 🤖 observer | Every FULL/SLIM checkpoint + pipeline completion | **Never blocks.** Advisory only. Scores user-AI collaboration pattern on 4 dimensions (Delegation Intensity / Cognitive Vigilance / Cognitive Reallocation / Zone Classification) per `shared/collaboration_depth_rubric.md`. Injects a named section into checkpoint presentation and a chapter in the Process Record. MANDATORY integrity gates (2.5 / 4.5) do NOT invoke the observer. | n/a — output is advisory; user `Ready to proceed?` prompt unchanged |
